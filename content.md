## About Me

![portrait](portrait.jpg){: class='portrait' width='200' height='200'}
I'm a Canadian software developer, and a computer science student at the University of Waterloo. In the past I've interned at Shopify, Stripe, and Coinbase; I currently work with Coinbase as a contractor on the Application Security team.

I love solving problems, especially problems that would be intractible without a computer. I'm particularly interested in distributed systems and machine learning.

I'm interested in internship opportunities, and I'm also open to conversations about full-time employment; feel free to [read my resume](resume.pdf), [connect with me on LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/as3richa), or [send me an email](mailto:as3richa@uwaterloo.ca).
